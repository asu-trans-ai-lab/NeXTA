DTALite is an open-source AMS library for efficiently macroscopic traffic
assignment based on General Modeling Network Specification (GMNS) format

\#Goals of DTALite development

1.  Provide an open-source code base to enable transportation researchers and
    software developers to expand its range of capabilities to various traffic
    management application.

2.  Present results to other users by visualizing time-varying traffic flow
    dynamics and traveler route choice behavior in an integrated environment.

3.  Provide a free, educational tool for students to understand the complex
    decision-making process in transportation planning and optimization
    processes.
