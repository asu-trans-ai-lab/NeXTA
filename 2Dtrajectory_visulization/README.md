**Format**

Each line is a record of trajectory

Please use space or comma to separate fields.

Main functions

1. **Display trajectories for each lane.**

1. You can show Vehicle ID, and you can use mouse wheeler to zoom in and zoom out the display in the certain portion.

1. You can use the mouse to click and draw a line in the space-time plate, and the NeXTA will automatically calculate the flow, density, and speed values across the line
